## Prerequisites

- Git (2.0+ recommended)
- Neovim

When setting up a new computer, if you have a working one at hand, it's worth
enabling passwordless ssh access to the new machine first and do the setup through
SSH.

```sh
ssh-copy-id <user>@<host>
```

## Packages

### Ubuntu

```sh
sudo apt install \
  git \
  ssh \
  apt-transport-https \
  ca-certificates \
  curl \
  gnupg \
  build-essential
  tree \
  htop \
  xsel \
  tmux \

```

## Install

### SSH key

The ssh key is needed to get this dotfiles from Github so it's inevitably the first step.

If I have access to another working machine, it's easier to copy the `~/.ssh` through `scp`.

Alternatively, I can get all key pairs from 1password, the personal and the work ones.

### Dotfiles

These dotfiles are installed with [thoughtbot's rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm). A suite of tools to manage dotfiles directories.

Check out whether everything will work fine:

```bash-session
lsrc
```

Install your dotfiles symlinking them into your home directory:

```bash-session
rcup -v
```

### Neovim

My Neovim configuration, based on [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/), is found in `config/nvim/`. Installing all dotfiles will also symlink it to `~/.config/nvim`. Then, open neovim, which will automatically install all plugins and LSP servers, and run `:LazyHealth` to check everything is working correctly.

Note Copilot will require calling `:Copilot auth` in any new device.

### Gnome

Run `source ~/.dotfiles/install/set-gnome-theme.sh` to install my own Gnome theme customizations.

## Fonts

[Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) is an awesome font perfectly suited for my console usage and Nvchad need for a Nerd Font. Go install it from their website.

Despite NvChad's suggestion to use Fira Code patched with icons, it's best to install a standalone symbols package to get icon support from Kitty. Install the Symbols Nerd Font Mono from [Nerd Fonts releases page](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases). The `kitty.conf` file will pick it up automatically. More details: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/faq/#kitty-is-not-able-to-use-my-favorite-font>.

### FZF

[FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) is an awesome fuzzy-finder I use from the terminal an as vim plugin. Make sure you read <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/README-VIM.md> as well. You should also read the vim plugin's README.

### Zsh

Since Zsh comes installed with Mac, you just need to install Oh My Zsh by running the following command, although check their website for up to date [installation instructions](https://ohmyz.sh/#install):

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

#### Dracula theme

Next, you can install the Dracula theme, which doesn't come with oh-my-zsh by default.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dracula/zsh.git dracula
mv ~/dracula/dracula.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/dracula.zsh-theme
```

#### Custom configuration

Environment variables and custom settings are organized in `config/ohmyzsh/config.zsh` to avoid modifying the main `.zshrc` file. This approach allows pulling dotfiles updates without losing personal configurations like PATH modifications, version manager setups, and system-specific settings. The `.zshrc` only sets `ZSH_CUSTOM=~/.config/ohmyzsh` to load all custom configurations from the config directory.

### Tmux

Beyond installing Tmux we also need to install [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm), the package manager.

### Z

[Z](https://github.com/rupa/z) is an awesome utility to move around the file
system based on "frecency" which makes me move much faster.

By typing `a fo` I cd to `~/dev/openfoodnetwork`.

There is no manual step required to install since I use its oh my zsh plugin.

## Git

I've included some handy git script additions as well as configution changes.
Have a look at
[.gitconfig](https://github.com/sauloperez/dotfiles/blob/master/.gitconfig) to see
various aliases and settings.

## Node

Node is needed for things like Neovim and many other tools.

Use Nodenv to install manage multiple node versions. Follow its installation steps at <https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv#installation>.

### Support for different patch versions

Oftentimes, projects define a `.node_version` up to the minor version leaving room for patch upgrades without having to constantly update the version.

To support this, you have to install [nodenv-aliases](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv-aliases). So you can alias versions like

```
nodenv alias 20.11 20.11.1
```

## Keyboard

To map Ctrl key to Caps lock:

### Ubuntu

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool
gnome-tweak-tool > Keyboard & Mouse > Additional Layout Options > Ctrl key position
```

## Cool utilities

### sp

[sp](https://gist.github.com/wandernauta/6800547) is a Spotify cli client that
allows you to play, pause, get the current song, etc. from the command line.
Just what I was looking for. Install it as follows

```sh
$ sudo curl -fLo /usr/local/bin/sp \
    https://gist.githubusercontent.com/wandernauta/6800547/raw/2c2ad0f3849b1b1cd1116b80718d986f1c1e7966/sp
$ sudo chmod ag+x /usr/local/bin/sp
```

Now, with the Spotify app open you can do `sp current` or `sp play`. Awesome!

## Stay Updated

Run the sync again!

```bash-session
rcup -v
```

## Pok3r mech keyboard

You can find how to program the pok3r in [[guide] How-to: Program your Pok3r -- Programming Layers and Dipswitch 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/35uy60/guide_howto_program_your_pok3r_programming_layers/) from the MechanicalKeyboards subreddit.

## Troubleshooting

### Getting Nvidia Quadro P1000 mobile to work

I couldn't an external monitor connected to my brand new Thinkpad P1 through HDMI until I updated the propietary Nvidia drivers and disabled Kernel mode setting on the Nvidia kernel module.

Keep in mind the HDMI port is wired to the Nvidia graphics card so you'll first have to switch to it either using `Nvidia X Server Settings` or the `prime-select` command line tool. I guess the latter gets installed with the `nvidia-prime` package but I haven't checked. Do not forget to log out and log in again for the changes to take effect.

In order to get the latest Nvidia drivers available I added the `graphics-drivers` PPA repository as follows

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
sudo apt update
```

Because of this, now `ubuntu-drivers devices` (you can find a nice explanation of this command [here](https://askubuntu.com/a/543329)) listed a couple more options

```
== /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0 ==
modalias : pci:v000010DEd00001CBBsv000017AAsd00002267bc03sc00i00
vendor   : NVIDIA Corporation
model    : GP107GLM [Quadro P1000 Mobile]
driver   : nvidia-driver-390 - distro non-free
driver   : nvidia-driver-418 - distro non-free
driver   : nvidia-driver-396 - third-party free
driver   : nvidia-driver-415 - third-party free
driver   : nvidia-driver-430 - third-party free recommended
driver   : xserver-xorg-video-nouveau - distro free builtin
```

Particularly `nvidia-driver-430` did not show up before. Unfortunately, the command `sudo apt install nvidia-driver-430` reported an unmet depedencies error so I went the GUI way. You can do so by opening the "Software & Updates" app, choosing the "Additional Drivers" tab. Then, choose "nvidia-driver-430" and "Apply Changes". This took a while.

But it turns out this wasn't enough, even after restarting the system. Finally, I found the solution in <https://www.dell.com/community/Precision-Mobile-Workstations/External-Monitor-not-working-Ubuntu-nvidia/m-p/7286631#M1634>. Apparently the problem is with the [kernel mode setting](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_mode_setting#Disabling_modesetting), which needs to be disabled to work.

Editing the file `/lib/modprobe.d/nvidia-kms.conf` to `options nvidia-drm modeset=0` fixed the problem after a reboot üéâÔ∏è.

### Recovering Grub after a Lenovo's firmware upgrade

After blindly applying the last firmware upgrade Grub was gone and there was no way to boot anything other than Windows 10. Disabling secure boot and enabling legacy boot didn't help either.

First of all, <https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/475245> shed some light on this giving some clues that led me to the solution. First kind of understood what [UEFI is about](https://www.howtogeek.com/56958/HTG-EXPLAINS-HOW-UEFI-WILL-REPLACE-THE-BIOS/) and what a [EFI system partition is](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/EFI_system_partition), then I run

```
bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \EFI\ubuntu\grubx64.efi
```

from Window's command prompt as admin, as detailed in <https://itsfoss.com/no-grub-windows-linux/>. Then reading [BCD System Store Settings for UEFI](BCD System Store Settings for UEFI) from Microsoft's Hardware Dev Center made me understand we basically told the Windows Boot Manager that it should boot grub's EFI application instead.

### Pipewire

Sorry, I don't remember all the things I did to make Pipewire work with Wireplumber but <https://pipewire-debian.github.io/pipewire-debian/> seems to be the best reference, togheter with <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PipeWire>, to understand and troubleshoot this.
